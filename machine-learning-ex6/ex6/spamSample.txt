Hello,

I came across your contact on the Internet and believe we might be of
mutual benefit to each other. I have a proposal for you that I believe
will be  mutually beneficial to us. I am David Muntai an investment
banker here in Ghana, due to the nature of my job I represent high
net-worth clients with eight figure sums in viable investment
portfolio globally through a blind investment trust serving as a
discreet special purpose vehicle.

A client of mine who passed away a couple of years ago left behind a
huge sum in a portfolio I managed for him without indicating a next of
kin. It is my intention to present you as his next of kin because you
bear the same last name with him and from the same country. If you are
willing to handle this transaction, kindly indicate promptly through
my private email (dnmuntai@gmail.com) to enable me advise on more
details. Please note that your role will be handsomely rewarded (50%).

Yours Sincerely,

David Muntai.
